Figure 6.13  Sample Run of a Partially Complete Program Containing Stubs
Enter a common fraction as two integers separated by a slash> 3/-4
Input invalid--denominator must be positive
Enter a common fraction as two integers separated by a slash> 3/4
Enter an arithmetic operator (+,-,*, or /)
> +
Enter a common fraction as two integers separated by a slash> 5/8
Entering find_gcd with n1 = 44, n2 = 32
gcd of 44 and 32?> 4
find_gcd returning 4

3/4 + 5/8 = 11/8
Do another problem? (y/n)> y
Enter a common fraction as two integers separated by a slash> 1/2
Enter an arithmetic operator (+,-,*, or /)
> 5
5 invalid, reenter operator (+,-,*,/)
> *
Enter a common fraction as two integers separated by a slash> 5/7
Entering multiply_fractions with
n1 = 1, d1 = 2, n2 = 5, d2 = 7
Entering find_gcd with n1 = 1, n2 = 1
gcd of 1 and 1?> 1
find_gcd returning 1

1/2 * 5/7 = 1/1
Do another problem? (y/n)> n
