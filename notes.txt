Functions only receive copies of the variables passed to them.

(Pass by Value rather than Pass by Reference.)  Means it makes a copy of 
the values of the original variable, but it cannot change the original variable.



Large items like strings or arrays cnnot be passed to functions either.
A function needs to know the address of a variable if it is to affect the original variable.

printf sends the address which can go to that address in memory 
to use pointer as function arguments.
